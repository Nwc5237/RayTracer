# RayTracer
A ray tracer with a wavefront (.obj) model loader

A ray tracer with phong shading, reflection, refraction, shadows, texture mapping,
antialiasing, and an obj file converter so that you can export many of your favorite
models to work with this engine.

BioShock model ripped from game, converted with my obj loader, and rendered on my ray tracer.
