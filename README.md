# RayTracer
A ray tracer with a wavefront (.obj) model loader

A ray tracer which utilizes the Unreal Engine 4 PBR shading model (adapted from Disney), reflection, refraction, shadows, texture mapping,
antialiasing, and an obj file converter so that you can export many of your favorite
models to work with this engine.

BioShock model ripped from game, converted with my obj loader, and rendered on my ray tracer.
